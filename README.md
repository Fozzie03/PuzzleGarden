# PuzzleGarden

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

# Needed Programs:
 - Unreal Engine 5.4.x
 - Github Desktop
 - Visual Studio 2022 (Latest Version)
     - Game Development with C++
 
# Setup
 1. On Github Desktop, clone this repository into Unreal Engine's Projects folder, traditionally located in the Documents folder.
 2. Open Visual Studio and open the project.
 3. If a pop-up occurs indicating that a module is out of date (or something along those lines), select "Yes" and let it rebuild the module.
 4. If the build fails, Visual Studio 2022 wasn't installed properly / an extension is missing.
